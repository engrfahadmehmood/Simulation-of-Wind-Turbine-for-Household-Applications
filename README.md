# Simulation-of-Wind-Turbine-for-Household-Applications
In this project, modeling and simulation of Wind Turbine for Household Applications is represented. MATLAB/Simulink is used to model the system which includes a 3-Phase Controlled Rectifier, Buck-Boost Converter with Integral Controller and a 3-Phase Inverter coupled with SPWM (Unipolar) technique, and PLL for grid synchronization.
